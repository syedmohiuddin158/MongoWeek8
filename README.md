#  MongoDB CRUD using Node.js and Mongoose


---

## Introduction
This lab demonstrates how MongoDB CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be implemented programmatically using Node.js and the Mongoose library. Instead of executing MongoDB commands manually, the application interacts with the database through backend code.

---

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Visual Studio Code
- MongoDB Compass

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed on your system:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB Community Server
- MongoDB Compass
- Visual Studio Code

---

## Installation Steps


1. Clone the repsitory:

git clone https://github.com/syedmohiuddin158/MongoWeek7.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd MongoWeek7


3. Install dependencies:

npm install


4. Running the Application:

Start the MongoDB service and then run:

node index.js




## Database Details

Database Name: Week8

Collection Name: personCollection

You can view the database and documents using MongoDB Compass.

##  Implemented Tasks

Task 1: Connect MongoDB and insert a single document

Task 2: Insert multiple documents using insertMany()

Task 3: Fetch records using find() and limit results

Task 4: Fetch records using filtering conditions

Task 5: Count total documents

Task 6: Delete documents using criteria

Task 7: Update documents using updateMany()

## Notes:

Deprecated MongoDB connection options were removed to support newer versions of Node.js and Mongoose.

All CRUD operations are implemented in a single file (index.js) as required.
